Matlab and Python codes implement a Tikhonov deconvolution based phase 
reconstruction algorithm from multi-axis DPC data. Images should be captured
with LED array illumination or other switchable light sources using four 
halves of the brightfield circle on in each image. The transfer functions 
are calculated according to the Weak Object Transfer Function and the absorption
and phase are solved with a least squares algorithm.

**Run the "main_dpc.m" under matlab_code folder or the "main_dpc.ipynb" 
  jupyter notebook under python_code with the example DPC dataset.
